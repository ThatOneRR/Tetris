# Tetris

Woah, another one? This one preceds SlayOne and was sort of a testament for me to see whether or not SlayOne was a possible thing to do in my capability. This is also the first standalone project that I've did.

Contains some bugs (heck, the pieces can go out of screen occasionally) and some very inefficient code but the concept is there :D.
